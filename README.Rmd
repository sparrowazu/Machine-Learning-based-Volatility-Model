# Building a Machine Learning-based Volatility Prediction Model  
  
This project will explore the different models of volatility prediction, first, using GARCH(p,q) model, and then LSTM-GARCH hybrid models. This study therefore considers the volatility of the data_ml stock index returns. 
  
# Data  
  
Data can be found in the data_ml.R file.  
  
# Model Building  
  
The model building process and codes can be found in Final Report file.  

# Members  
  
Maya Le: GARCH models  
Jason Yu: LSTM-GARCH
